# Welcome to the Batmanhood ReadMe!

This is a full-stack web application built using React + Redux (front-end) & SQLAlchemy + Flask + PostgreSQL (back-end)

This project is [currently hosted on Heroku](https://batmanhoodapp.herokuapp.com/)!

Much like it's side-kick, Batmanhood is a stocks analysis and management website that allows consumers easy access to stocks purchases without the need for a third-party broker. No commissions, no hassles, and no actual stocks or money - Batmanhood, your comprehensive resource for pretending to be a major player in the stock market!
